## Should I use a Custom Select Javascript Library?

No.

### <select> a reason below:

    >    <select>
    >      <option>You can style them with CSS</option>
    >      <option>Most custom libraries don't handle accessibility</option>
    >      <option>Browser behavior for select elements is totally different on mobile devices</option>
    >      <option>Most custom libraries don't handle accessibility</option>
    >      <option>If they did handle accessibility completely, they'd be bigger than you should tolerate</option>
    >      <option>It's a slippery slope, what about multi-select</option>
    >      <option>But Bootstrap even adds autosuggest to a select element ...</option>
    >    </select>
